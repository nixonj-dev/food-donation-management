🎉 **Project Completed: Food Donation Management System** 🍲

I’m excited to share my recent project – a **Food Donation Management System** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP & MySQL**.

🔧 **Modules:**
- **Donor**: Donate food, give feedback  
- **NGO**: Track donations, view analytics  
- **Delivery**: Accept and fulfill orders  

🧠 This project was created to connect food donors with NGOs and ensure safe delivery to the needy. It helps reduce food waste and ensures meals reach homeless individuals and charities efficiently.
